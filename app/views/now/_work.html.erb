<div class="description">
	<p><strong>web development.</strong> I've built for the web using PHP, Django, and Rails within the last few years. Each paltform has its place. The trick is understanding the task at hand and knowing which structure to use.</p>
	<p><strong>UI/UX design.</strong> I do my best to keep up with web standards and conventions. The worst thing for your users is to visit your site and have them unsure of what to do next. I cut my teeth on this while working in corporate for a Big Ag company and have continued to hone my skills on user interactions in multiple environments ever since.</p>
	<p><strong>reporting.</strong> One of the most difficult design needs is that within the world of data reporting. It's really easy to mislead viewers when showing off a dataset. It takes refinement and honesty to show what's really going on. Web reporting opens up a lot of possiblities but the ideas behind my methods of designing reports comes form <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com">Edward Tufte</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>database management.</strong> When working corporate, I picked up a number of SQL Server skills and have continued to write SQL for my web builds. I'm not a professional DBA but I've worked as a Data Analyst enough to understand the basics of how to setup and operate a database.</p>
	<p><strong>agriculture.</strong> I was raised on a large farm in central Missouri. As the saying goes, "farming is in my blood." That's why I've used my skills within the realm of agriculture in the past. I've been transitioning a bit recently and have plans to start a small farm in the future as opposed to working with and for agricultural companies.</p>
